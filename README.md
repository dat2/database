# database

reference: https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/

This is a sqlite inspired database program written in Rust, to learn the key concepts of database implementations.

Some of the concepts are:
- A SQL REPL using [a rust implementation of readline](https://github.com/kkawakam/rustyline)
- A SQL parser using [parser combinators](https://github.com/Geal/nom)
- The format of a database file, including pages and internal row structures
